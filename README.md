Hackathon Challenge: 

## What
We challenge your teams to design and create a new and improved Jarvis “home” landing page, complete with a plan to drive web traffic to the site. Your team should look at our existing home landing page and can select content you feel is most relevant from any section of our site to design the ultimate homepage. 
On top of the challenge of creating this page, we also task you with creating a strategy to drive traffic to our page. Get creative, you have just over 3 hours to ace this assignment! You’ll have a chance to share your webpage, rationale for design and content choices, and web traffic strategy in a 15 minute presentation to our three judges. The winning team will get a surprise prize! 

## Parameters 
You are only intended to create a home landing page, not a full website. 
You should use content that can be found on our website and social media accounts, but you are not required to use the exact content on our current homepage, instead we challenge you to pick what content from any Jarvis page makes most sense.
You must work as a team to agree on design, among technical and non technical team members.
Taylor & Jinnettte will float and be available for general questions
